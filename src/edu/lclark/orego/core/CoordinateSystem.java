/**
 * Coordinate system to convert between a short and other representations of a
 * location. There is no public constructor for this class; instead, use the
 * static method widthOf to get the appropriate instance.
 * <p>
 * A point is represented as a single short. This is an index into a
 * one-dimensional array representing the board, with a buffer of sentinel
 * points around the edges.
 * <p>
 * The standard idiom for accessing all points on the board is:
 *
 * <pre>
 * for (short p : getAllPointsOnBoard()) {
 * 	// Do something with p
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The standard idiom for traversing all orthogonal neighbors of point p is:
 *
 * <pre>
 * short[] neighbors = getNeighbors(p);
 * for (int i = FIRST_ORTHOGONAL_NEIGHBOR; i &lt;= LAST_ORTHOGONAL_NEIGHBOR; i++) {
 * 	short n = neighbors[i];
 * 	// Do something with n, which might be an off-board point
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * To traverse diagonal neighbors, do the same, but with DIAGONAL substituted
 * for ORTHOGONAL. To traverse both, use a for-each loop on neighbors.
 * <p>
 * On those rare occasions where rows and columns are used, rows are always
 * zero-based from the top, columns from the left.

Classes for running and analyzing experiments.

<p>To run an experiment:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Edit (and recompile) ExperimentConfiguration.java. Here you can set the path to GNU Go
(or whatever standard opponent you're using), the command-line options to Orego for each
condition, and other options.</p></li>
<li><p>Make and clear the results directory specified in ExperimentConfiguration.java.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are running on a cluster, run Broadcast using the command</p>

<pre><code>nohup java -cp /path/to/Orego/binaries/ orego.experiment.Broadcast &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are only running on a single machine, instead run GameBatch with the command</p>

<pre><code>nohup java -cp /path/to/Orego/binaries/ orego.experiment.GameBatch &lt;HOST&gt; &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>where &lt;HOST> is one of the hosts listed in orego.experiment.ExperimentConfiguration (note that if you are running an experiment locally, the host will probably have the form <em>hostname</em>.localhost, with <em>hostname</em> being the name of your computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically run Collate to display the results.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to kill an ongoing experiment, run KillExperiment. Note that this is running
<code>kill -9 -1</code> on all of the machines listed in ExperimentConfiguration.java, so it
will kill all of your processes and log you out.</p>

<p>To check for statistical significance (whether one condition is better than another), run Significance.</p>
